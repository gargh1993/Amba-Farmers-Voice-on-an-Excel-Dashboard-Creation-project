Your first task is to use the provided “CSV Data Set” (you can find it in the Resources) of transactions at a supermarket and analyse the data to answer some questions. We suggest you complete this task in Excel or an open-source alternative like LibreOffice Calc.

Task details and the answers you need to find are listed below in an email from the team lead:

Hello,

I have provided you with a data set named “supermarket_transactions.csv.” This data set contains three years of transactional data we collected from supermarkets across Australia. 

InsightSpark wants to access our data to perform some analysis across Australian supermarkets. Before this can happen, I need you to perform some analysis on the provided CSV data set (a sample of the database) to answer the following questions:

Across locations, how many apples were purchased in cash?
How much total cash was spent on these apples?
Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?
You should conduct your analysis in Excel or a spreadsheet program of your choice. In your file, document the formulas used to generate your values. When finished, please submit the analysed file for me to review before we share our findings with InsightSpark.
